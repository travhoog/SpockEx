# SpockEx

## Introduction

SpockEx is short for "Spock Exchange", which is itself a play on "Stock Exchange". The idea is a mashup of two concepts: one of trading and commerce, and the other from the post-capitalist economy in the fictional Star Trek universe. Thus, the "Spock Exchange" is intended as a means of exchange of goods and services that bypasses rather than replaces the need for money.

The SpockEx application is intended to be a tool for connecting peers on a distributed, non-hierarchical database, for the purposes of sharing and storing information redundantly. The intended data to be shared can be, but is not limited to, records of freely-shared goods or services (or assets), along with nested records of the freely-shared assets that serve as components for the resulting asset, the data for which can be stored locally or by the peers who provided each component asset.
