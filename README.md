# SpockEx

##Introduction

SpockEx is short for "Spock Exchange", which is itself a play on "Stock Exchange". The idea is a mashup of two concepts: one of trading and commerce, and the other from the post-capitalist economy in the fictional Star Trek universe. Thus, the "Spock Exchange" is intended as a means of exchange of goods and services that bypasses rather than replaces the need for money.

The SpockEx application is intended to be a tool for connecting peers on a distributed, non-hierarchical database, for the purposes of sharing and storing information redundantly. The intended data to be shared can be, but is not limited to, records of freely-shared goods or services (or assets), along with nested records of the freely-shared assets that serve as components for the resulting asset, the data for which can be stored locally or by the peers who provided each component asset.

To facilitate this, a new protocol for connecting peers must be concieved. This protocol is called Entanglement.

> Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distanceâ€”instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole.

As the name suggests, SpockEx "Entanglement" makes connections personal but forcing users to make physical contact in order to interract at a distance. While this approach may introduce some unique limitations, we beleive the practice of sharing confidential keys and connection information offline versus online will also make the protocol extremely robust and secure.

## Entanglement Protocol (Rough Draft, WIP)

###1. Offline communitcation

* Peer A generates a JSON message within a QR code or NDEF message for Peer B to read. The message contains a peer-unique ID, along with the peer's external IP address, a peer-unique encryption key, a peer-unique salt, and a total peers message (integer from 0-max). since much of this data is peer-unique, Peer A must record a this data associated with Peer B in a relational dataebase, and anticipate more peer-unique info yet to come from Peer B. If Peer A doesn't know it's external IP, it'll get this from Peer B later, and sends an "unknown" message for now.

   #### JSON Offline Handshake: 
   
   ```json
   {
      "request": 100,
      "peerInfo": {
         "pid": "0c41c34e-bda2-405b-ae0b-c66e41c5b2db",
         "host": "either an IP address or 'unknown'",
         "key": "d23bf636a4df498aa498d7e14ea781c0",
         "salt": {
            "string": "#d7",
            "index": 14
         },
         "testString": "a random string used to test later"
      }
   }
   ```

* Peer B generates an ID, key and salt that will only be used with Peer A. This data is peer-unique, so Peer B must record a this data associated with Peer A and Peer A's information in a relational dataebase. 
* Responds via the same ofline method with this information, as well as its IP address and total peers. If Peer B does not know its external IP address, it runs IPgetter script. IPgetter should be used rarely.

   #### JSON Offline Response: 
   
   ```json
   {
	   "response": 200,
	   "peerInfo": {
		   "pid": "af2ef074-637e-4d18-83b3-047f5daf355f",
		   "host": "123.45.67.89",
		   "key": "459c5876704649cb930de10b39bb5610",
		   "salt": {
			   "string": "#9j",
			   "index": 9
		   },
		   "testString": "a random string used to test later"
	   }
   }
   ```

   #### JSON Offline Error: 
   
   ```json
   {
      "response": 400, 
      "errorText": "A brief summary of what went wrong."
   }
   ```

###2. Online Handshake

* Upon reciept, Peer A and B run NAT punching proceedures to open that IP and port on the router. (How? Not sure yet.)
* Peer A then sends a JSON message to Peer B over IP with Peer ID and an encrypted packet using agreed upon codes, keys and salts.

   #### JSON Online Handhake: 
   
   ```json
   {
	"request": 110,
	"peerId": "0c41c34e-bda2-405b-ae0b-c66e41c5b2db",
	"payload": "encrypted string"
   }
   ```
   
   #### Payload decrypted:
   
   ```json
   {
	"pid": "af2ef074-637e-4d18-83b3-047f5daf355f",
	"testString": "the random string from offline exchange"
   }
   ```
   
   (Timeouts will result in an error message, with a "Retry" or "Cancel" option. Retry goes back to the begining of step #2. Canceling must delete all prior pending data for this peer connection.)

* Peer B confirms the identity of the IP message using previous codes, keys and salts.
* If succesful, Peer B responds with a success message, includes relevant peer-unique codes, tells Peer A his external IP, and sends it all encrypted via Peer A's key and salt. If not successful, sends error.

   #### JSON Success: 
   
   ```json
   {
	"response": 200,
	"echoHost": "234.56.78.90",
	"request": 120,
	"peerId": "af2ef074-637e-4d18-83b3-047f5daf355f",
	"payload": "encrypted string"
   }
   ```
   
   Note: Peer A can now know and record it's own external IP, if it doesn't know already. We will ALWAYS echo back the IP of the host we are talking to from this point on. It's just a handy way to keep track of changing IP's when those hosts are mobile.
   
   #### Payload decrypted:
   
   ```json
   {
	"pid": "0c41c34e-bda2-405b-ae0b-c66e41c5b2db",
	"testString": "the random string from offline exchange"
   }
   ```

   #### JSON Error: 
   
   ```json
   {
      "response": 400, 
      "echoHost": "234.56.78.90",
      "errorText": "A brief summary of what went wrong."
   }
   ```
   
   (Timeouts will result in an error message, with a "Retry" or "Cancel" option. Retry goes back to the begining of step #2. Canceling or errors must delete all prior pending data for this peer connection.)

* Peer A confirms the identity of the IP message using previous codes, keys and salts. If succesful, Peer A sends a success message. Peer A also generates a Cluster UID, and sends it to Peer B. If something isn't right, sends error.

   #### JSON Success:  
   
   ```json
   {
      "response": 200, 
      "echoHost": "123.45.67.89",
      "request": 130,
      "paylaod": "A brief summary of what went wrong."
   }
   ```
   
   #### Payload decrypted:
   
   ```json
   {
	"clusterId": "f4c68ab-2da2-48fb-bca8-a124d299a915",
	"members": ["af2ef074-637e-4d18-83b3-047f5daf355f", "0c41c34e-bda2-405b-ae0b-c66e41c5b2db"]
   }
   ```

   #### JSON Error: 
   
   ```json
   {
      "response": 400, 
      "echoHost": "123.45.67.89",
      "errorText": "A brief summary of what went wrong."
   }
   ```
   
   (Timeouts will result in an error message, with a "Retry" or "Cancel" option. Retry goes back to the begining of step #2. Canceling or errors must delete all prior pending data for this peer connection.)

* Peer A and B are now trusted peers and a new peer cluster has been generated between them. Peer B accepts with a success code.

   #### JSON Success: 
   
   ```json
   {
      "response": 200, 
      "echoHost": "234.56.78.90"
   }
   ```

###4. Entanglement Protocol Request/Response Codes

Request/response codes will be similar to HTTP status codes. New codes will be appended to this table.
